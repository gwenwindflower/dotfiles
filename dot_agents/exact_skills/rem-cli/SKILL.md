# rem — macOS Reminders from the terminal

rem is a single-binary Go CLI that reads and writes the Apple Reminders database in under 200ms via EventKit (cgo). Every `rem` invocation is fast and safe to run.

## Current time (do not guess, use these values)

- Today: !`date +"%A, %B %-d, %Y"`
- ISO date: !`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- Local time: !`date +"%H:%M %Z"`
- Day of week: !`date +"%A"`
- Tomorrow (ISO): !`date -v+1d +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- Next Friday (ISO, always forward): !`date -v+1d -v+fri +"%Y-%m-%d"`

**When the user says relative dates like "tomorrow", "next friday", "end of week", or "last tuesday", resolve them against the values above before calling rem.** Don't ask the user "what is today" and don't guess from training data.

rem's `--due` flag accepts natural language directly (see [references/dates.md](references/dates.md)), so in many cases you can pass the user's phrase through verbatim. But if the user asks something ambiguous ("what was I supposed to do yesterday?"), use the ISO date above and query rem with `--due-before` / `--due-after` against an exact date.

## When to use this skill

Use rem any time the user wants to:

- Add, list, search, complete, or delete macOS Reminders
- Summarize "what's due today" / "what's overdue" / "what's coming up"
- Capture quick tasks from natural language ("remind me to call dentist tomorrow")
- Move reminders between lists, reprioritize, or add URLs and notes
- Export reminders to JSON / CSV, or import them back
- Manage reminder lists (create, rename, delete)

Do NOT use rem for:

- Calendar events (use `ical` if available, or AppleScript with Calendar.app)
- Other Apple apps (Notes, Messages, Mail)

## Quick decision tree

| User intent | Command to reach for |
|---|---|
| "what's on my plate" / "today" / "what's overdue" | `rem today`, `rem overdue`, `rem upcoming --days N` |
| "remind me to X (tomorrow / friday / etc)" | `rem add "X" --due <date>` |
| "remind me about X at Y time" | `rem add "X" --due "<date> <time>"` — notification is automatic |
| "remind me 15 minutes before" | add `--remind-me 15m` to `rem add` |
| "make that one silent / no notification" | add `--silent` to `rem add` (not available in `-i` mode, see gotchas) |
| "tell me more about X" / "show that reminder" | `rem show <short-id>` |
| "mark X as done" | `rem complete <short-id>` |
| "undo that / mark X as not done" | `rem uncomplete <short-id>` |
| "delete X" | `rem delete <short-id>` (supports multiple IDs) |
| "find reminders about X" | `rem search "X"` |
| "flag / unflag X" | `rem flag <short-id>` or `rem unflag <short-id>` |
| "show me flagged stuff" | `rem list --flagged` |
| "move X to list Y" | `rem update <short-id> --list "Y"` |
| "change priority to high" | `rem update <short-id> --priority high` |
| "add notes to X" | `rem update <short-id> --notes "..."` |
| "tag this as work" / "add tags" | `rem add "Task #work"` or `rem update <short-id> --add-tags "work,urgent"` |
| "remove the urgent tag" | `rem update <short-id> --remove-tags "urgent"` |
| "make it repeat weekly / monthly" | `rem add ... --repeat weekly` or `--repeat "weekly on mon,wed,fri"` |
| "clear the due date on X" | `rem update <short-id> --due none` |
| "what lists do I have" | `rem lists` (add `--count` for per-list totals) |
| "how many reminders total / stats" | `rem stats` |
| "export my Work list" | `rem export --list Work --format json --output-file work.json` |
| "import this CSV" | `rem import file.csv --dry-run` first, then without |

## Output formats (always set one when scripting)

Every read command supports `-o table|json|plain`. Default is `table` (colored ASCII). When piping to another tool, into a script, or when you need to parse the result, use `-o json`:

```bash
rem today -o json | jq '.[] | .name'
rem overdue -o json | jq 'length'
rem list --incomplete --list Work -o json
```

`NO_COLOR=1` disables colors. `REM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` disables the background update check (set it when scripting to avoid stray output).

## Short IDs

rem displays the first 8 characters of each reminder's UUID as its "short ID" (e.g. `AB12CD34`). You can pass any unique prefix to commands — `rem complete AB1` works as long as it matches exactly one reminder. Prefer short IDs when showing reminder IDs back to the user.

## Notifications default to ON

When `--due` is set on `rem add`, rem auto-attaches an alarm at the due time. This matches Apple Reminders.app behavior. **Do NOT pass `--remind-me 0m` to enable notifications — that's already the default when `--due` is set.**

- `rem add "Review PR" --due tomorrow` → notifies at tomorrow 9 AM (default due time)
- `rem add "Review PR" --due "tomorrow 2pm" --remind-me 15m` → notifies 15 minutes before
- `rem add "Groceries" --due tomorrow --silent` → due date, no notification (checklist-style)

Full detail: [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) `rem add` section.

## URLs go in the native Reminders.app URL field

When the user wants a link attached to a reminder, pass it via `--url`. rem writes to the real Reminders.app URL field (not the notes body), so the link shows in the Reminders.app UI with Apple's native link card rendering. Clear a URL with `--url ""`.

```bash
rem add "Review spec" --due friday --url https://example.com/spec.pdf
rem update AB12 --url https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
rem update AB12 --url ""    # clear
```

## Critical gotchas

1. **macOS only.** rem uses EventKit via cgo. Will fail on Linux — detect OS first if you're unsure.
2. **Priority uses word forms, not raw numbers.** Pass `--priority high|medium|low|none`. rem does accept raw ints, but Apple's 1–9 scale is inverted (1 = highest, 9 = lowest), so the words are safer when relaying from user input.
3. **`--due none` clears** the due date in `rem update`. Same for `--remind-me none` and `--repeat none`.
4. **Flagged and tags use private API.** Both go through Apple's private ReminderKit framework since EventKit doesn't expose these properties. Sub-200ms like everything else, but may break on future macOS versions. Tags degrade gracefully — if the private API is unavailable, the reminder is created/updated without tags and a warning is printed.
5. **Tags from title are additive.** `#hashtags` in the title are parsed and stored as native Reminders.app tags. They stay in the title text AND become tag objects. Pure numbers like `#42` are ignored (treated as issue references, not tags).
6. **`rem delete` prompts by default.** Pass `--force` / `--yes` / `-y` when scripting to skip the confirmation.
7. **`rem add -i` (interactive form) has no `--silent` equivalent.** If a user wants a silent reminder via the interactive flow, create it normally and then run `rem update <id> --remind-me none` to clear the alarm.
8. **Old reminders with URLs in the notes body** (`URL: https://...`) still read correctly as a backward-compat fallback. New reminders always use the native URL field.

## Reference files (load when needed)

- **[references/commands.md](references/commands.md)** — Complete flag reference for every rem command. Load when you need specific flag details, default values, or full usage examples.
- **[references/dates.md](references/dates.md)** — Natural language date grammar accepted by `--due`, `--due-before`, `--due-after`, and `--remind-me`. Load when constructing a date string from a user's phrasing.

## Common patterns

### Daily briefing
```bash
rem overdue -o plain
rem today -o plain
rem upcoming --days 3 -o plain
```

### Scripted cleanup
```bash
# Archive completed Work items to a JSON backup
rem export --list Work --format json --output-file work-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Count overdue items
rem overdue -o json | jq 'length'
```

### Quick capture from a user message
When the user says something like "remind me to call mom tomorrow at 5pm", parse the title, due date, and list (if mentioned) and run a single `rem add`:

```bash
rem add "Call mom" --due "tomorrow at 5pm" --list Personal
```

Always confirm the short ID of the created reminder back to the user so they can reference it later.
