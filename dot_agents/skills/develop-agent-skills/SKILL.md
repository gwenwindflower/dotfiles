Create and improve Agent Skills: modular packages extending agents with specialized workflows, domain knowledge, and bundled resources.

**Skills must be very terse and high signal.** Every line should earn its place — if a sentence doesn't change agent behavior, cut it. Skill content is loaded into context on every trigger; bloat directly costs tokens and dilutes the instructions that matter.

Reference docs: [overview](overview.md) is pulled from the official Agent Skills spec. Consult it when you need to look up schema details, frontmatter options, or structural rules — don't read it routinely.

## Workflow

1. Ask clarifying questions about skill goals, preferences, or examples
2. Plan contents (additional files? scripts? assets?)
3. Consult [overview](overview.md) if you need schema or structural details
4. Scaffold with `rei skills new <skill-name>` (skip for existing skills)
5. Write SKILL.md, add scripts, modular docs, and assets as needed
6. Validate with `rei skills validate <skill-path>`
7. Distribute to agent targets with `rei sync` (or `rei skills sync <name>`)

Follow in order. Skip steps only with clear reason. User can opt out of validation.

## `rei` CLI

Skill management lives under `rei skills`. Reishi keeps a single source of truth and syncs to every configured agent target (Claude, OpenCode, the shared `~/.agents/` location, etc.) via copy or symlink.

Skills source defaults to `~/.config/reishi/skills/`. Run `rei config show` to see effective config and targets.

### Create

```bash
rei skills new my-skill                           # scaffold in skills.source
rei skills new my-skill --path path/to/project    # custom location
```

Generates a scaffold with a SKILL.md template plus `scripts/` and `assets/` dirs. Customize or remove as needed. Modular reference docs go directly in the skill root, linked from SKILL.md.

#### Structure Example

Here's a real skill called github-actions-workflows, which bundles reusable workflow templates, modular reference docs, and an installation script for scaffolding workflows into projects:

```text
 github-actions-workflows
├──  assets
│   ├──  ci.yml.tmpl
│   ├──  release-build.yml.tmpl
│   └──  release.yml.tmpl
├──  scripts
│   └──  executable_install-workflow.sh
├──  ci.md
├──  release-build.md
├──  release.md
└──  SKILL.md
```

For simple skills, delete the `assets/` and `scripts/` dirs after scaffolding to reduce clutter.

### Validate

```bash
rei skills validate <skill-path>
```

### Add External Skills

```bash
rei skills add <github-tree-url>             # single skill or whole skills dir
rei skills add -tp <github-tree-url>         # track for future pulls, prefix with org
```

`-t/--track` records the remote in the lockfile so `rei skills pull` can fetch updates later. `-p/--prefix` namespaces skills (infer from GitHub org, or pass an explicit value).

### Sync and Pull

```bash
rei sync                              # sync all constructs (skills/rules/docs) to targets
rei skills sync [name] [--dry-run]    # skills only; --check inspects without writing
rei skills pull [name] [--check]      # fetch updates for tracked skills (network)
```

`sync` is local-only and always safe. `pull` hits GitHub for tracked skills, with divergence protection — locally modified files stay put and remote versions land alongside as `<filename>_1.md`.

Auto-sync runs after `skills new`, `add`, `activate`, `deactivate`, and `pull`.

### List and Manage

```bash
rei skills list                       # active skills
rei skills list --all                 # include deactivated
rei skills deactivate <skill-name>    # hide without deleting
rei skills activate <skill-name>      # restore
```

## Loading Model

1. **Startup**: Only name + description loaded — aim for <100 tokens each, this determines trigger quality
2. **Triggered**: Full SKILL.md loaded — this is why terseness matters. Every token here competes with the user's actual task context. Link to modular docs for depth rather than inlining it — reference links should be formatted as `[example](example.md)` pointing to files colocated with the SKILL.md
3. **On demand**: References, assets, scripts loaded as needed — use many small modular files for progressive disclosure
